# Advent of Code Rust Template

## How to use (from template)

1. Generate a repo from this template with the name AOC20XX where XX is the current year. Pull it down and run make year. 
2. Copy your cookie from AOC 20XX into a file named session_cookie.txt (this is already listed in .gitignore).
3. In the terminal type `make day=X` where X is the day you want to run. This will create a folder for the day you specify and pull your text input for day X into the folder as well as create a python file that reads the input. For rust do `make rust day=X` which will set up a cargo project instead.
