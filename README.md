The following will document my descent into madness


| **Day**  | **Comments**                              |
|----------|-------------------------------------------|
| Day 1    | I miss python string indexing             |
| Day 2    | My input parsing ability leaves a lot to be desired...                                         |
| Day 3    | I would rather just forget about today...                                  |
| Day 4    |            Finally some good food.             |
| Day 5    |                     Awful.                      |
| Day 6    |                       Up the mathematics                    |
| Day 7    |                       Can't believe I actually used structs and traits. Still don't understand lifetimes on trait implementations though...           |
| Day 8    |       What's LCM and what's a naming convention                                    |
| Day 9    |                       easy sequences                    |
| Day 10   |                     Praise be rule based debugging                    |
| Day 11   |         OFF BY ONE ERRORS!!!!                                  |
| Day 12   |                                           |
| Day 13   |                                           |
| Day 14   |                                           |
| Day 15   |                                           |
| Day 16   |                                           |
| Day 17   |                                           |

| Day 19   |                                           |
| Day 20   |                                           |

| Day 23   |                                           |
| Day 24   |                                           |
